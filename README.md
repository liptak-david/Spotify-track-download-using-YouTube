This code works by showing tracks of playlist via spotify-api and than searching each track on Youtube and downloading the first video youtube will recommend. 
In order to use this code you will need to have installed python and some IDE like VS Code, next you will need to have instlled ffmpeg so the code will not show error and some python libraries written in requirements.txt which you can install by typing to terminal pip install requirements.txt.
Code was written with big help from Claude.ai and Chat GPT.
